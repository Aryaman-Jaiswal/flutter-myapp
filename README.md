# Flutter Staffing & Project Management App

A comprehensive, cross-platform application built with Flutter for managing users, clients, projects, and tasks. This application demonstrates a clean architecture using the Provider state management pattern, a local SQLite database, and a responsive UI designed for both desktop and web.

## Overview

This project was developed as a case study in building a modern, feature-rich business application with Flutter. It follows a role-based access control system where an administrator can manage all aspects of the application, while regular users have more limited access. The application is designed to be a central hub for a hypothetical staffing or consulting agency to manage its clients and the projects/tasks associated with them.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Roles:**

  - Secure user signup and login.

  * Role-based access control (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `User`).
  * The first user to sign up is automatically assigned the `SuperAdmin` role.

  - Admins can view a list of all users, add new users, and edit user details including role assignments.

- **Client Management:**

  - Admins and users can add new clients with name, mobile number, and city.
  - A clean, table-like view displays a list of all clients.

- **Project & Task Management:**

  - **Hierarchical Structure:** Create high-level **Projects** associated with a specific client.
  - **Task Management:** Within each project, create and manage individual **Tasks**. Each task includes a name, description, assigned user, start date, and deadline.
  - **Interactive Timer:** A built-in time tracker for each task allows users to start and stop a timer. The tracked time persists across app sessions and navigation.
  - **Multiple Views:**
    - **Board View:** A Kanban-style view that groups tasks by status (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `On Review`, `Ready`).
    - **Timeline View:** A Gantt chart representation of all tasks within a project, showing their duration and overlap.

- **Reporting:**

  - A dedicated reporting section for generating and downloading project/task data.
  - Reports can be filtered by a specific **Client**, **Project**, **Developer (User)**, or a **Date Range**.
  - Generated reports are downloaded as a `.csv` file directly from the browser.

- **Responsive & Cross-Platform UI:**
  - The user interface is built to be responsive, working seamlessly on desktop and web browsers.
  - Features a persistent side `NavigationRail` for top-level navigation and a dynamic content area.
  - Modern, clean design inspired by contemporary web dashboards.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Framework:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- **Language:** [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- **State Management:** [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - For a simple and effective separation of UI and business logic.
- **Routing:** [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) - For declarative, URL-based navigation suitable for web and deep linking.
- **Local Database:** [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) - For persistent storage on mobile and desktop.
  - **Cross-Platform Support:** `sqflite_common_ffi` (for Desktop) and `sqflite_common_ffi_web` (for Web) ensure the database works everywhere.
- **UI & Components:**
  - **Material 3:** The application uses the latest Material Design guidelines.
  - **gantt_view:** For the interactive project timeline/Gantt chart.
  - **animate_do:** For subtle entrance animations on the Login and Sign-up screens.
  - **csv:** For generating reports.
- **Architecture:** The project follows a clean architecture pattern, separating UI (Screens), state management (Providers), data models (Models), and data persistence (Services/DatabaseHelper).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Flutter dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Setup for Web (Crucial Step):**
    The `sqflite` web implementation requires special binary files. Run the following command in your project root to install them into the `/web` directory:
    ```bash
    dart run sqflite_common_ffi_web:setup
    ```

## Running the Application

### Running on Web (Recommended)

1.  Make sure you have Chrome installed.
2.  Select "Chrome (web-javascript)" from the device dropdown in your IDE (VS Code / Android Studio).
3.  Run the application (e.g., press `F5` in VS Code).

### Running on Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)

1.  Ensure you have the necessary build tools for your target desktop platform.
2.  Select your desktop device (e.g., "Windows (windows-x64)") from the device dropdown.
3.  Run the application.

### First Use

Since there is no default admin account, the **very first user to sign up will automatically be assigned the `SuperAdmin` role**.

1.  Launch the app.
2.  Click "Don't have an account? Sign Up".
3.  Register your first user. This will be your admin account.
4.  Log in with the credentials you just created.

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud Backend:** Replace the local SQLite database with a cloud-based solution like Firebase (Firestore, Authentication) or Supabase for real-time data synchronization, robust authentication, and scalability.
- **Advanced Reporting:** Enhance the reporting module with graphical charts, more complex filtering, and different export formats (e.g., PDF).
- **Task Dependencies:** Add logic to create dependencies between tasks in the timeline view.
- **Notifications:** Implement in-app or push notifications for task assignments, deadlines, and status changes.
- **Unit & Widget Testing:** Build out a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
